## 1. What is MGSe ?
MGSe is stand for **Monopoly Go Script** and the letter **e** is for english version.This apps will help us **minimizing** the usage of dice we use when completing the event at MonopolyGo game.Because is just more on "automation" and to save my time,this apps actually just a simple automation script that i made using "tasker".

## 2. The main function for MGSe
MGSe help us to minimize our dice usage by expoiting current monopoly vulnerability that the dev still not fix.This apps will help us to "return back to our last position" if we did not wan the latest tile or position.Just think this apps just like a "time machine" that can help us "goes back to past" if we do not get the place that we wan in monopolygo game.

I made short video for you to see example of how this "time machine" work,pay attention on my position,current dice and what will happen when i click **Reset** Button :

Now we should can clearly see why i call this apps is just like "time machine".When we goes back to our last state before,we will get back the dice that we already spent on that move.

> This is how we can minimize the usage of our dice we use for completing the event.Only targeting tiles that give us a point for event.Goes back or reset back if we did not land on non event tiles.Repeat this process until we finish the event.

## 3. Advantage of MGSe
The main advantage for this apps is : 
- This app not required our device to be rooted.Some apps with similar like this need a rooted environment for it to work.And most of non-tech user will just using a VM and installing SU inside their VM.

This apps is created for solving often crash problem when using a VM in our device.

> p/s : VM that i means is Android Virtual Machine.Not solely on Virtual Master.There are many varity of Android Virtual machine that available like vmos,vphonegaga,virtual master,f1vm etc.

## 4. Disadvantage of MGSe
Because this apps is running on unrooted device or stock device,this apps only have a limited function due to security limitation on stock device.But the most important thing,the function for roll/reset back to the last state is working.

## 5. File and Installation Guideline
To avoid making this post become long,i have seperated the posting at
